Currently looking for an entry level job as a software developer

### **Recent Milestone**

### Motive

<blockquote>
It is interesting how a problem can be solved using computers. what we can create in the modern days using the resources available to the open world is truly overwhelming, I intend to absorb a considerable portion of this overwhelming knowledge to become a developer I believe there are a lot more things in our lives that can be done much better through technology like automating simple things to eliminate human repetition.
